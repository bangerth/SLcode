Code provided here was used for calculations in the paper "Glacial isostatic adjustment shapes proglacial lakes over glacial cycles" by J. Austermann, A.D. Wickert, T. Pico, J. Kingslake, K. Callaghan, and R. Creel

This folder includes the main code to calculate the size and extent of past proglacial lakes (SL_equation_viscoelastic_lakes.m) along with a folder of necessary functions for this code (SLFunctions) and the love numbers (LN). The high resolution topography from GEBCO and ice model input is too big to store on github. It has therefore been uploaded to Zenodo:
